            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I’m a passionate and creative individual best known for my signature pink hair and bold, expressive style. With a strong background in the beauty industry, I’ve always been drawn to the art of transformation—whether through hair or digital design. Recently, I’ve expanded my skills into the world of front-end development, driven by a desire to grow, learn, and challenge myself in new ways. My journey into coding reflects the same energy I bring to everything I do: vibrant, curious, and constantly evolving. I thrive on blending aesthetics with functionality, and I’m excited to keep building beautiful, user-friendly digital experiences that reflect both my creativity and technical ambition.</p>

            </header>
            <article>
            <p>My journey in the hairdressing industry began in 2014, when I started studying and working at the prestigious corporate salon, Gary Rom. Through dedication, hard work, and a passion for the craft, I quickly rose through the ranks—achieving the highest stylist level within four years and being promoted to Salon Manager in my fifth year. During this time, I discovered and honed my specialized skills in extensions and colour, which have since become my signature services.</p>
            <p>Building on this foundation, I took a bold step and opened my own salon, where I continue to express my creativity and deliver exceptional results to my clients. Alongside managing my salon, I’ve also had the privilege of working as a freelance representative for Schwarzkopf—a brand that played a significant role in shaping me into the stylist I am today. Through this partnership, I not only work with their professional products but also help educate and inspire other stylists across South Africa.</p>

            <p> This transformation video captures a behind-the-scenes look at one of my favorite client journeys—from the moment she stepped into the salon to the final reveal. Our goal was to enhance the manageability of her natural curls while introducing fresh dimension through advanced colour techniques, including a soft, seamless balayage. As a proud representative of South Africa competing in “Miss Teen Model” in the USA, she needed a look that was both glamorous and authentic. We completed her transformation with custom-placed extensions to add length and volume, giving her that extra edge on the international stage. Every step was crafted with precision, passion, and purpose to help her shine—on and off the runway.</p>
